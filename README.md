# Docker-compose-Jenkins

This Project aims to build a application using redis and a pre-built image from the Dockerhub. The container created out of the image will run on the localhost 5000 and increase the number of counter every time we refresh the page.

To get the Jenkinsfile and Docker-compose file, checkout to the master branch. :)
